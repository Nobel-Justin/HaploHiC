## Version
V0.32

## Installation

HaploHiC is written in PERL. All of its functions are packaged into a standalone PERL module. Besides, it also requires other additional modules.

To install HaploHiC, you need to download HaploHiC and add the current directory to the `PERL5LIB` path.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nobel-Justin/HaploHiC.git
PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:$PWD; export PERL5LIB
```
List of additional PERL modules required:
- [JSON](https://metacpan.org/pod/JSON)
- [SVG](https://metacpan.org/pod/SVG)
- [Parallel::ForkManager](https://metacpan.org/pod/Parallel::ForkManager)
- [List::Util](https://metacpan.org/pod/List::Util)
- [BioFuse](https://github.com/Nobel-Justin/BioFuse)

If you encounter problems, please open an issue at the [project on Github](https://github.com/Nobel-Justin/HaploHiC/issues).

## Usage
HaploHiC provides series of commands for Hi-C data analysis.
```
Usage:   perl HaploHiC.pl <command>

Commands:

-- Haplotype work
   haplo_div      divide the diploid haplotype (P/M) Hi-C reads from alignment.
   plotLocReg     plot phased local region information.
   adjustDump     adjust HaploHiC dump contacts based on juicer dump contacts.

-- Extensions
   juicer_db      make database files for juicer and HaploHiC operations.
   run_juicer     set up workspace and shell file to run juicer.
   juicerDump     run juicer dump, and merge the inter-chr and intra-chr.
   FRAG_gene      convert FRAG contacts to gene level contacts.
```

### Haplotype work
- [haplo_div](./manual/haplo_div.md)

`haplo_div` loads alignment file(s) of Hi-C data and haplotype information, and assigns haplotypes to Hi-C PE-reads of unknown parental origin according to contacts information (**local contacts ratio**) in local genomic regions with dynamic size.

- [plotLocReg](./manual/plotLocReg.md)

`plotLocReg` loads statistics generated by `haplo_div` to plot information of phased local region which calculates the **local contacts ratio**.

- [adjustDump](./manual/adjustDump.md)

`adjustDump` adjusts HaploHiC dump contacts based on [juicer](https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer) dump contacts. The HaploHiC dump contacts are generated by the last step of `haplo_div`.

### Extensions
- [juicer_db](./manual/juicer_db.md)

`juicer_db` automatically prepares database files. This database supports operation of both [juicer](https://github.com/aidenlab/juicer) and HaploHiC.

- [run_juicer](./manual/run_juicer.md)

`run_juicer` automatically sets up workspace and shell file for juicer operation.

- [juicerDump](./manual/juicerDump.md)

`juicerDump` runs juicer `dump` on each pairwise inter/intra-chr chromosomes, and merge the results.

- [FRAG_gene](./manual/FRAG_gene.md)

`FRAG_gene` loads contact matrix of **FRAG** level, and outputs the **GENE** level contacts.
